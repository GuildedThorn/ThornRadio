# React Side

This is the dotnet side of my React + Tailwind + ShadCN / Dotnet + MongoDB Template.

You will want to configure your database and JWT info in appsettings.json/appsetings.Development.json.

You might also wanna setup a JWT secret key in either your enviornment variables for the server or /Properties/launchSettings.json

Please note this is all boilerplate code and provides minimum functionality for authentication, this template does not come with oauth yet or 2fa.
